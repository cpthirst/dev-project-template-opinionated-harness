# dev-project-template-opinionated-harness

A reusable **TypeScript monorepo scaffold** with a **layered agent harness** for [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code). It was extracted from a project that started as an interview-prep wiki, and is now a starting point for new projects: a small, deliberately empty app plus the instructions, skills, reviewers, hooks and pipelines that let coding agents work in it autonomously without quality slipping.

```bash
pnpm install   # Node 26, pnpm 12 (also installs the git hooks)
pnpm dev       # web on :5173 + API dev server on :3000 (Vite proxies /api)
pnpm check     # lint + docs lint + typecheck + tests + cdk synth: the definition of "done"
```

Open http://localhost:5173 and you should see **"API: ok (dev)"**: the Vue app calling the API's health endpoint end to end.

The app is intentionally minimal. The API uses **no framework**: each endpoint is a plain `async` function with the AWS Lambda / API Gateway (HTTP API, payload v2) signature, so it can deploy to Lambda unchanged. The CDK stack has **no resources** until a story needs them. Frameworks, hosting and AWS resources each arrive through a story and an ADR, never by default.

## The harness

The design principle (ADR 0002): **instructions advise, hooks enforce, reviewers judge, and CI is the final authority.** No single layer has to be perfect, because each one backs up the one before it.

| Layer | Runs | What it does | Can it be skipped? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` + ADRs | every session | Commands, workflow, conventions, autonomy limits, decision history | Yes (advisory) |
| Skills | on demand | Repeatable procedures with approval checkpoints and templates | Yes (advisory) |
| Permissions | every tool call | Allow, ask or deny specific commands and files | No |
| Claude Code hooks | before and after every action, and on finish | Block risky actions, give instant feedback, push back on "done" while the gate is red | No (for agents) |
| Reviewer subagents | before every PR | Independent, read-only review: code, tests, security, infra | Yes (standing rule to run them) |
| Git hooks (Lefthook) | commit and push | Format, commit-message rules, no pushes to `main`, gate before push | Only deliberately |
| CI | every push and PR | The same gate on GitHub's machines, plus PR-title checks | No |

### 1. Instructions: `CLAUDE.md` and ADRs
[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) is loaded into every agent session, so it stays short and holds only what an agent would otherwise get wrong:
- the commands, the TDD loop and the definition of done;
- the git rules;
- what agents may do alone, what needs asking, and what is never allowed;
- the review loop, and a list of gotchas.

[docs/adr](docs/adr) records *why* things are the way they are, so agents don't "fix" deliberate choices:

| ADR | Decision |
|---|---|
| [0001](docs/adr/0001-record-architecture-decisions.md) | Record architecture decisions |
| [0002](docs/adr/0002-layered-agent-harness.md) | Layered agent harness |
| [0003](docs/adr/0003-independent-subagent-review.md) | Independent subagent review before done |
| [0004](docs/adr/0004-versioning-with-release-please.md) | Conventional Commits + release-please versioning |
| [0005](docs/adr/0005-framework-free-sandbox-scaffold.md) | Framework-free sandbox scaffold |
| [0006](docs/adr/0006-vanilla-lambda-shaped-api-handlers.md) | Vanilla, Lambda-shaped API handlers |
| [0007](docs/adr/0007-behaviour-named-tests-coverage-at-review.md) | Behaviour-named tests; AC coverage checked at review |

### 2. Skills (`.claude/skills/`)
A skill is a packaged procedure. Only its one-line description is always in context; the steps load when it's used. They form a delivery chain:

```
write-prd ──► story-map ──► write-story ──► implement-story ──► open-pr
 prd.md       epics →        Given/When/     test-first per AC,   PR template,
 FR1..n       stories        Then ACs        gate + review loop   push asks first
                                   adr ◄── records significant decisions along the way
```

| Skill | Produces | Checkpoints |
|---|---|---|
| `write-prd` | `docs/product/<feature>/prd.md` (problem, goals and metrics, FR1..n) | User approves the PRD |
| `story-map` | `story-map.md`: epics → small vertical-slice stories, FR coverage table | User approves the map |
| `write-story` | One story with Gherkin acceptance criteria | Definition of ready |
| `implement-story` | Code, test-first per acceptance criterion; gate, review loop, story marked `done` | Stops and asks if an AC is ambiguous |
| `open-pr` | Conventional PR title, filled template, push | Push needs approval; never merges |
| `adr` | `docs/adr/NNNN-*.md` | Proposed → Accepted by the user |

`pnpm lint:docs` validates every story's structure, so a malformed story fails the gate.

### 3. Reviewer subagents (`.claude/agents/`)
Subagents run in their own context and report back. Fresh context matters: the agent that wrote the code is a poor judge of it. All four reviewers have **no Edit or Write tools**, so they can report problems but can't "fix" them by weakening a test. A harness test enforces that. They run on Sonnet to keep cost down.

| Reviewer | Runs when the diff touches | Focus |
|---|---|---|
| `code-reviewer` | always | Correctness, scope against the story, conventions, ADR conformance, changed or deleted tests, **brevity and clean code** for the next human reader |
| `test-auditor` | a story is being implemented | Maps each acceptance criterion to the test(s) covering it, by behaviour. Would the test fail if the behaviour broke? |
| `security-reviewer` | `apps/`, `packages/shared`, any `package.json` or `pnpm-workspace.yaml` | Input validation, auth, secrets, data exposure, frontend injection, dependencies |
| `infra-reviewer` | `infra/`, or API packaging and deployment | IAM, public exposure, destructive replacement, removal policies, cost |

**The review loop** (defined once, in CLAUDE.md): the routed reviewers run in parallel. Every `blocker` must be fixed, and only the reviewers that blocked re-run, for at most 2 rounds before escalating to a human. `should-fix` and `nit` findings go into the PR's "Review notes". Every reviewer returns the same format (`Verdict: PASS | BLOCKED` plus `[severity] file:line` findings), so findings can be processed mechanically.

### 4. Claude Code hooks (`.claude/hooks/`, registered in `.claude/settings.json`)
These are hooks in Claude Code's agent loop, not git hooks. Their output goes back to the agent, which acts on it. The logic is TypeScript that plain `node` runs directly, with unit tests in the gate.

| Hook | Event | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| `guard.ts` | **PreToolUse**, before every edit or command | **Denies** hand-editing `pnpm-lock.yaml`, writing `.env*` files, adding `.skip`/`.only`/`.todo` to test files, bypassing git hooks, and committing or pushing while on `main` |
| `post-edit.ts` | **PostToolUse**, after every edit | Runs Biome on the file, then typechecks the package that owns it. Errors go straight back to the agent (with a note that type errors are expected during the TDD red phase) |
| `stop-gate.ts` | **Stop**, when the agent tries to finish | Runs `pnpm check` if the tree is dirty or the branch is ahead of `main`. **Blocks the first attempt to finish while the gate is red**; on the retry it lets the agent stop, so it reports the failure instead of looping |

Alongside the hooks, [permissions](.claude/settings.json) let agents run `pnpm`, local git commands and `cdk synth`/`diff` freely. They **ask** before `git push`, `gh pr`, `cdk deploy`, `aws` commands and edits to `.claude/` or `.github/`. They **deny** force-pushes, pushes to `main`, `cdk destroy` and reading `.env` files.

### 5. Git hooks (Lefthook)
These cover humans and agents alike, and `pnpm install` installs them.

| Hook | Checks |
|---|---|
| `pre-commit` | Biome on staged files |
| `commit-msg` | commitlint: a Conventional Commit with an allowed scope |
| `pre-push` | `protect-main.sh` rejects any push to `main` (including `HEAD:main`), then `pnpm check` runs |

The `pre-push` hook stands in for GitHub branch protection, which the free plan doesn't enforce on private repos.

### 6. CI, Dependabot and releases (`.github/`)

| Workflow | Trigger | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `ci.yml` | push to any branch except release branches | `pnpm check`, the same gate as local |
| `pr-title.yml` | `pull_request_target` | commitlint on the PR title. With squash merges, the title becomes the commit on `main` |
| `release-please.yml` | push to `main` | Keeps a release PR open (version bump + CHANGELOG). Merging it creates the `vX.Y.Z` tag and a GitHub Release |
| `dependabot.yml` | weekly | Grouped updates: `fix(deps)` for runtime dependencies (patch release), `chore(deps)` for dev dependencies, `ci(deps)` for GitHub Actions |

Every action is **pinned to a commit SHA**, and workflows use least-privilege tokens.

**The type decides the version:**

| Commit type | Release |
|---|---|
| `fix` | patch |
| `feat` | minor |
| `feat!` or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer | major (minor while below 1.0.0) |
| `chore`, `ci`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor` | none |

## How a change flows

1. **Idea** → `write-prd` → you approve the PRD.
2. `story-map` → you approve the epics and story slices → `write-story` creates stories with Given/When/Then ACs.
3. `implement-story` on a branch. For each AC: **red** (a failing, behaviour-named test) → **green** → **refactor**. The hooks format and typecheck every edit as it happens.
4. **Gate:** `pnpm check`. The Stop hook pushes back if the agent tries to finish while it's red.
5. **Review loop:** the routed reviewers run in parallel and every blocker is fixed. The story is marked `done`.
6. `open-pr`: push (you approve it, and the `pre-push` hook runs the gate again) → PR with a Conventional Commit title.
7. **CI** re-runs the gate and checks the title → **you squash-merge**.
8. release-please updates the release PR → **you merge it when you want to release** → tag, GitHub Release and CHANGELOG.

---

## Conventions

- **TDD, strict gates:** no production code without a test that exercised it first. `pnpm check` green is the definition of done.
- **Tests are named after behaviour** (`it("returns 404 for unknown routes")`), never after stories or tickets. Changing or deleting a test is fine when the behaviour or design changes; say why in the commit.
- **Strict TypeScript:** `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, and no `any`, `as` casts or `!`. ESM, with `.ts` import extensions.
- **The API contract lives in `packages/shared`** as zod schemas, used by both the API and the web app.
- **Code is written for the next human reader:** brief, intention-revealing names, small functions, no speculative generality, and comments that explain *why*.
- **Trunk-based development:** short-lived branches, small PRs (aim for under 400 lines) and squash merges. Conventional Commits with scopes `web api infra shared tooling harness deps docs release` (`main` is also allowed, for release-please only).

## The journey so far

This repo was built iteratively, as a coaching exercise in harness engineering. Each iteration added one layer, then tested it against reality.

| Step | What was built | What we learned |
|---|---|---|
| **0. Scaffold** | pnpm monorepo, strict TS, Biome, Vitest, CLAUDE.md, permissions | A good CLAUDE.md is short: only what an agent would otherwise get wrong. Version clashes (TS 7 vs `vue-tsc`, CDK vs `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`) belong in Gotchas |
| **1. Hooks** | guard / post-edit / stop-gate, Lefthook | Hooks catch their author too: the guard blocked a test command, and the Stop gate caught unformatted hook files. **A guard you haven't seen block something isn't a guard yet** |
| **2. Skills** | PRD → story map → story → implement → PR, ADRs, docs validator | A template is only a suggestion until a check enforces it. Approval checkpoints sit where mistakes are expensive: scope and slicing |
| **3. Subagents** | Four read-only reviewers + the review loop | Restricting tools enforces separation of duties. The clean-code standard went into *both* the author's rules and the reviewer's checks |
| **4. CI** | `pnpm check` on GitHub, Dependabot | We **dropped** an AI PR review in CI: it repeated the local review loop at extra token cost. *Gate where risk enters, not everywhere* |
| **5. Versioning** | commitlint, PR-title check, release-please | Real releases exposed real bugs: a first release proposed as 1.0.0 (missing `initial-version`), release PR titles failing commitlint, Biome rejecting release-please's manifest, and bot PRs waiting for approval (fixed by triggering CI on `push` and title checks on `pull_request_target`) |
| **6. Branch protection** | `pre-push` hook | GitHub doesn't enforce rulesets on free private repos. Lefthook silently skipped the check on already-pushed branches, so the protection moved into a script |
| **7. Reset** | Removed the assumed Hono / Lambda / CloudFront stack (ADR 0005) | Agents copy whatever patterns they find. Unmade decisions shouldn't sit in the code looking like made ones |
| **8. Walking skeleton** | Lambda-shaped health handler, `node:http` dev server, Vue health status (ADR 0006) | `security-reviewer` caught the dev API listening on every network interface; it now binds to loopback |
| **9. Releases** | Plain `vX.Y.Z` tags | Changing the tag format risks release-please losing track of the previous release. `bootstrap-sha` was the safety net while moving to the new format |
| **10. Test naming** | Behaviour-named tests; AC coverage judged by `test-auditor` (ADR 0007) | A name proves nothing about what a test checks. Reviewers mapped every AC to its test from behaviour alone, and found a real gap in the process |

Two process lessons recur throughout. First, **watch every check fail once before trusting it**. Second, **run the review loop before every PR**: skipping it "to save tokens" defeats the harness, so it's now a standing rule.

---

## Known trade-offs

- **Reviewers have `Bash`**, which they need for `git diff`, `cdk diff` and running tests. "Read-only" therefore relies on the prompts plus permissions and hooks, not on a hard sandbox.
- **AC coverage is a review judgement** (ADR 0007), not a deterministic gate. A coverage threshold is the fallback if reviewers ever miss uncovered ACs.
- **Release PRs skip CI and the title check by design.** They only bump the version and CHANGELOG of already-gated commits.
- **CI on `push` tests the branch head**, not the branch merged with `main`. That's fine for short-lived branches; `main` is checked again after every merge.
- **Nothing is deployed yet.** The CDK stack is empty until a story adds resources, and deploying from CI will need OIDC and a token that can start workflows.

---

## Reusing this as a template

This repo is a GitHub **template repository**. To start a new project:

```bash
gh repo create <new-name> --template cpthirst/dev-project-template-opinionated-harness --private --clone
cd <new-name> && pnpm install && pnpm check
```

Or use **"Use this template"** on GitHub. The new repo starts with fresh history at version `0.0.0`.

Then:

1. **Rename** `dev-project-template-opinionated-harness` in `package.json`, `release-please-config.json` (`package-name`), `apps/web/index.html` and `apps/web/src/App.vue`. Also rename the CDK stack id `DevProjectTemplate` in `infra/bin/app.ts`.
2. **Replace or delete** the example walking-skeleton story in `docs/product/platform/`.
3. **GitHub settings:**
   - **Actions → General**: allow GitHub Actions to create pull requests (release-please needs this).
   - **General → Pull requests**: squash merging only, with "Pull request title" as the default commit message.
   - **Rules**: add a ruleset for `main`, as this repo has. Rulesets are enforced on public repos, or on private ones with GitHub Pro. The ruleset should:
     - require a pull request (0 approvals, squash only) and linear history;
     - require the `check` and `commitlint` status checks, with the branch up to date;
     - block force-pushes and deletion;
     - let the **Repository admin** role bypass it, **for pull requests only**. Release PRs skip CI and the title check by design (ADR 0004), so without this bypass they could never be merged. Admins still can't push to `main` directly.
4. **Start the first feature** with the `write-prd` skill.
